# What
Spinner Wheel that lets you pick movies. 
Has intense featurebloat and a whole game built into it. 

# Why 
Christmas Gift for my partner. 

# How
1. Movie List is loaded from a Google Doc link at the top 
    - the doc has around 2400 lines as of creation- each line is a term on the wheel 
2. A spinning wheel randomly selects an item. 
3. A button is created to search that item on Letterboxd.
